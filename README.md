# .dotfiles

My configurations!

I'm starting from scratch. I want something I can `git clone` onto new computers and 
all the setup will be done for me. 

Initially I will have to symlink them manualls. I've seen some scripts 
(shoutout to @xLegoz for his [.dotfiles"](https://github.com/xLegoz/.dotfiles) inspiration) 
but I haven't decided on the strategy but it should be written in bash or python. 

This project is also going to be a listing for my TODO. I want to become a bit more 
independent from the big-web-corp, ideally creating an easy solution to privacy and 
safety on my computer. 

TODO:

- [ ] Look for a browser that:
  - has dotfiles configuration, 
  - preferable with vim bindings (enabled through those dotfiles)
  - some kind of syncing capabilities 
  - high security and anonymity
  - Check out https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_applications/Internet#Web_browsers
- [ ] Hook the YouCompleteMe compile into the script
- [ ] Look for a file syncing utility that is 
  - open source
  - secure
  - has a web interface 
  - locally managed?, maybe distributed, maybe with a central server?
- [ ] Look for high grade open source encryption
- [ ] Better email management (same qualities as above)
- [ ] Better calendar management
